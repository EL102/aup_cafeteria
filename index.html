      <h3>1. Plain Rice </h3>
      <p>Sekiro is set in the Sengoku period – that fraught time in Japan’s history, ranging from the mid-15th century to the tail end of the 16th, in which the land was riven, and ravaged by war. It’s far back enough into the past that memory blurs and shifts into myth, and it’s become something of a Sengo-to, so to speak, for any game looking to mingle history and fantasy.</p>

      <h3>2. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>
      <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).</p>

      <h3>3. Dishonored 2</h3>
      <p>Dishonored 2 takes everything you loved about Dishonored and improves upon it without becoming bloated. It's a beautifully designed, layered game, stuffed with hidden gems and secret stories. Also you can stab people in mid air.</p>

      <h3>4. Dark Souls 2</h3>
      <p>Dark Souls. That's the really hard one, right? Sure, but the difficulty is far from why it is so memorable. The freedom of choice when it comes to every aspect of your adventure, the rich lore of the world that makes everything have a purpose and the intelligent approach to multiplayer is what actually makes it. All of these factors are present in this long-awaited sequel.</p>

      <h3>5. Far Cry 5</h3>
      <p>The charismatic John promises atonement for would-be Eden’s Gate recruits in Holland Valley, Faith manipulates the thoughts and realities of people along the Henbane River through the drug Bliss, and up in the Whitetail Mountains Jacob trains his religious soldiers in twisted trials.</p>

      <h3>6. Portal 2</h3>
      <p>It begins in what appears to be a motel room; a quaint little cubicle furnished with a bed, desk and the odd decorative object. You've been asleep for some time, hauled out of a mammoth slumber by an energetic banging on the door and a familiar voice. It's that Bristolian chap from the Barclays adverts, Ricky Gervais' pal - Stephen Merchant. Only here he's a spherical robot with a blinking blue eye - something known as a Personality Sphere.</p>

      <h3>7. Monster Hunter World</h3>
      <p>As a member of the Fifth Fleet, the latest group of hunters to follow an elder dragon to a new world, you're tasked by the Research Commission to explore the land and study the new species of wyverns you encounter. For 'study' read 'bring 'em in, dead or alive', but the monsters won't go down without a fight either way.</p>

      <h3>8. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</h3>
      <p>Wolfenstein 2 picks up right after the events of the first game, with former Allied forces soldier B.J. Blazkowicz and his fellow freedom fighters still looking to spill the blood of those persecuting the American people, abolishing the world of Nazi rule in the process. This is over 10 years after U.S.A.’s concession, though, and some Americans are happy under German rule.</p>

      <p>My name is Jared Ibañez, a second year student at Adventist University of the Philippines studying Information Technology. 

          Born at —and raised in Puting Kahoy, Silang, Cavite, I’ve basically lived my life exploring and widening my horizons in this small town of Cavite. I’ve engaged in many activities of this school: small group, choir, —-, you name it! However, when I was invited to play with the computer, I was hooked. It made me connect with millions of people across the globe enhancing our skills in terms of intellect and memory via video games.</p>
